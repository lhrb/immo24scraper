# immo24scraper

A web scraper for immobilenscout24 that will send you an email everytime a new offer (matching your search cirteria) goes online 

> Why should I use this? Immobilenscout24 already has a notification feature.

However, the notification feature appeared to be kind of unreliable, so I came up with this DIY solution.

> Where should I run this?

e.g. raspberry pi, heroku dyno or any pc running 24/7
